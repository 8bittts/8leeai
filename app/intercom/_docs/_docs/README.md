# Release Notes Documentation

This directory contains monthly release notes for the 8lee.ai project.

## File Structure

Release notes are organized by month using the following pattern:
- `[year]-[month].md` (e.g., `2025-november.md`)

## Formatting Guidelines

- **Date-based organization**: All entries for a day appear under the same date heading
- **No timestamps**: Use only the date (e.g., "November 18, 2025")
- **Clear sections**: Group related changes together
- **Concise but comprehensive**: Include enough detail for developers and stakeholders

## Current Files

- `2025-november.md` - November 2025 release notes

## Note

These files are manually curated by the project maintainer. Only modify when explicitly requested.
