      "description": "We're in the process of migrating from our legacy ticketing system to your platform, and we have several questions about the migration process. First, what's the maximum amount of historical data we can import? We have 10 years of ticket history (roughly 500K tickets) that we'd like to preserve. Second, what tools/APIs do you provide for data migration? Do you have pre-built connectors for our current system (Kayako)? Third, what happens to custom fields during migration - will they map automatically or do we need to do manual configuration? Fourth, how long does a typical migration take for an account our size? Fifth, what's your approach to downtime during migration? Can we do a parallel run or cutover migration to minimize disruption? Finally, do you provide any training or change management support as part of the migration? We're planning a go-live in Q2 2025 and need to understand the timeline and resource requirements.",

Queries that previously returned in 2-3 seconds are now taking 30-60 seconds. We haven't changed our query parameters or request volume. The issue affects all types of searches: simple text searches, complex ZQL queries, and filtered searches. When we run the same query directly through the admin dashboard, performance is normal. This suggests the issue is with the API implementation or how it handles programmatic requests versus UI requests. We're concerned this may affect our customers if not resolved quickly.",

      "description": "We've been using your platform for 6 months now, and overall it's been a solid solution. However, I'd like to provide some constructive feedback about areas that could be improved. First, the reporting and analytics capabilities feel limited. We can generate basic reports, but we can't create custom dashboards for specific metrics we care about (like SLA compliance by team, resolution time by category, or customer satisfaction trends). Being able to build custom dashboards would transform this feature from adequate to excellent. Second, the mobile app, while functional, doesn't feel optimized for our use case. We need to be able to assign tickets, update statuses, and add internal notes while on the go, but the interface is cramped and navigation is unintuitive. Consider redesigning for better touch interactions and larger buttons. Third, the API documentation, while comprehensive, lacks practical examples for common use cases. Adding code examples in Python, JavaScript, and Go would be incredibly helpful for our integration efforts. Finally, we'd love to see better integrations with communication tools we use (Slack, Teams, Discord) for real-time notifications and quick actions.",

The pattern seems to occur between 8-10 PM UTC, which corresponds to our peak usage times. When the issue occurs, approximately 30% of our requests fail with timeout errors (>30 second response time). We've verified that our network connection is stable, and other external APIs work fine during these periods. Our current implementation includes exponential backoff and retry logic, but we're losing transaction data. Can you check your server logs for any anomalies during these specific time windows? Our account ID is ACC-12345 and we can provide detailed logs from our side if needed.",

      "description": "We've been using your platform for 6 months now, and overall it's been a solid solution. However, I'd like to provide some constructive feedback about areas that could be improved. First, the reporting and analytics capabilities feel limited. We can generate basic reports, but we can't create custom dashboards for specific metrics we care about (like SLA compliance by team, resolution time by category, or customer satisfaction trends). Being able to build custom dashboards would transform this feature from adequate to excellent. Second, the mobile app, while functional, doesn't feel optimized for our use case. We need to be able to assign tickets, update statuses, and add internal notes while on the go, but the interface is cramped and navigation is unintuitive. Consider redesigning for better touch interactions and larger buttons. Third, the API documentation, while comprehensive, lacks practical examples for common use cases. Adding code examples in Python, JavaScript, and Go would be incredibly helpful for our integration efforts. Finally, we'd love to see better integrations with communication tools we use (Slack, Teams, Discord) for real-time notifications and quick actions.",
